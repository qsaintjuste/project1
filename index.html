    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
    Welcome to my personal website. This page reflects my academic journey,
    professional goals, leadership mindset, and long-term vision. I believe
    growth is intentional, and everything I pursue is aligned with becoming
    a highly skilled and disciplined cybersecurity professional.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Academic Background</h2>

    <p>
    I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Applied Cybersecurity and
    Information Technology Management at Illinois Institute of Technology.
    I previously completed my Associate degree in Cybersecurity with a GPA
    of 3.66 and earned the Illinois Tech Purpose Scholarship for academic
    excellence and leadership potential.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    My coursework includes Ethical Hacking, Cybercrime & Incident Response,
    Cloud Computing, Scripting for Cybersecurity, Information Security Systems
    Analysis, and Networking fundamentals. I am also preparing for the
    CompTIA Security+ certification to strengthen my security foundation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Professional Experience & Leadership</h2>

    <p>
    Beyond academics, I have built strong leadership and administrative
    skills through professional experience. At Chicago Public Schools,
    I supported special education students, tracked behavioral data in Excel,
    and generated performance reports that influenced academic planning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I have also worked in management roles where I supervised teams,
    handled scheduling logistics, and resolved high-pressure situations.
    These roles strengthened my communication, adaptability, and decision-making skills.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Personal Growth & Discipline</h2>

    width="400" height="250" alt="Fitness discipline">
    
    <p>
    Discipline defines my life. Fitness is not just physical — it represents
    mental strength and consistency. Inspired by figures like David Goggins,
    I believe in pushing past limits and choosing discomfort in order to grow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Daily structure, early workouts, goal tracking, and continuous learning
    are habits I practice intentionally. I do not chase motivation —
    I build systems that make success inevitable.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>

    width="400" height="250" alt="Future vision">
    
    <p>
    Long-term, I aim to become a respected cybersecurity professional who
    combines technical expertise with leadership and resilience.
    I want to contribute to protecting digital infrastructure and help
    organizations operate securely in an evolving technological landscape.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I believe success is built daily — not occasionally. Every skill,
    experience, and challenge compounds into long-term growth.
