        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        
        <h2>Technology & Cybersecurity</h2>

        <p>
        Technology is not just a field of study for me — it is a long-term commitment.
        I am deeply interested in cybersecurity, network systems, and understanding
        how digital infrastructures are protected from modern threats.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I enjoy learning how vulnerabilities are discovered, how attacks are prevented,
        and how ethical hacking plays a role in strengthening systems.
        The complexity of cybersecurity challenges motivates me to continuously
        improve my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Fitness & Mental Discipline</h2>
        
        <img src="media/Fitness.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Fitness discipline">
        
        <p>
        Fitness represents discipline and mental toughness in my life.
        I am inspired by David Goggins and his mindset of pushing beyond limits.
        His philosophy of embracing discomfort changed the way I approach
        both physical training and academic challenges.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Working out consistently builds structure in my daily life.
        I believe that mental resilience developed through physical effort
        translates directly into professional growth and success.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Soccer & Competitive Spirit</h2>
        
        <img src="media/Soccer.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Soccer passion">
        
        <p>
        Soccer is one of my biggest passions. I admire players like Lionel Messi
        for his vision, discipline, and consistency over many years at FC Barcelona.
        His leadership and humility demonstrate that greatness is built through
        daily improvement.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I also closely follow rising talent like Lamine Yamal, whose confidence,
        creativity, and composure at such a young age show the importance of
        preparation and belief. Watching Barcelona play reinforces my love
        for teamwork and strategic thinking.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Anime & Storytelling</h2>
        
        <img src="media/Eren.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Eren Yeager">
        
        <p>
        I enjoy anime because of its strong character development and complex
        moral themes. One character that stands out to me is Eren Yeager from
        Attack on Titan.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Eren’s willingness to fight for freedom and protect those he cares about
        highlights themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and conviction. The depth of the
        storyline shows how perspective shapes decisions and how difficult
        leadership choices can be.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Travel & Cultural Growth</h2>
        
        <img src="media/Travel.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Travel and culture">
        
        <p>
        Traveling and experiencing different cultures expands perspective.
        Exposure to new environments strengthens adaptability and communication.
        I value multicultural awareness and being able to connect with people
        from diverse backgrounds.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Learning from different cultures strengthens my worldview and
        helps me grow both personally and professionally.
